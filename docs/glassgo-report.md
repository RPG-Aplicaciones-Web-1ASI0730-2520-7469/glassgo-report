## 1.2. Solution Profile
### 1.2.1 Background and Problem Statement

**Who (Who is affected?)**  
 The main affected are:

* Heavy cargo transport companies in Peru, facing high operating costs due to inefficient routes, vehicle wear, and accidents.

* Liquor distributors, who must cover economic losses due to glass bottle breakage and partial theft of merchandise during transport.

* Bar, liquor store, and restaurant owners, who receive incomplete or late orders, affecting inventory planning, promotions, and sales.

**What (What happens?)**  
 The logistics chain for liquor transportation in Peru presents structural problems:

* Truck fleets with an average age of 17 years (MTC, 2023), increasing the risk of failures and merchandise damage.

* Limited real-time cargo traceability: only 50% of logistics companies use digital tracking systems (Andina, 2023).

* Losses due to bottle breakage reach up to 3% of transported cargo in the beverage sector (Durán, UNI, 2020).

**Where (Where does it happen?)**

The problem occurs in the Peruvian market for alcoholic beverage transportation and distribution, especially on high-consumption interprovincial and urban routes (Lima, Arequipa, Trujillo, Cusco). The impact is greater on small and medium-sized transport and distribution companies, which lack resources to implement advanced technological solutions.

**When (Since when and how often?)**

This problem is persistent and structural. Although technological advances have improved efficiency in other sectors, digitalization in beverage logistics in Peru is slow. The problem occurs daily with each product delivery and intensifies during high-demand seasons (national holidays, year-end, regional campaigns).

**Why (Why is it a problem?)**  
 The lack of digitalization and logistical control generates serious consequences:

* **Economic**: losses due to breakage, replacements, theft, and delays.

* **Operational**: inefficient routes, fleet wear, and lack of traceability.

* **Commercial**: delivery failures affect trust between distributors and clients.

* **Strategic**: without consolidated data, it is impossible to plan inventories and optimize costs.

**How (How does it manifest?)**

* Orders arrive incomplete or late.

* Merchandise damaged during transport (broken bottles due to vibrations and poor stacking).

* Difficulty monitoring cargo location and status in real time.

* Informal coordination processes between carriers, distributors, and clients.

* Limited ability to react to unforeseen events on the road.

**How Much (What is the quantitative impact?)**

* Land transport in Peru moves more than 80% of national cargo (MTC, 2024).

* Fleet age averages over 17 years, increasing risk of failures (MTC, 2023).

* Glass container breakage represents up to 3% losses in beverage transport (Durán, UNI, 2020).

* Road interruptions cause losses of up to S/ 280 million daily in the transport sector (RPP, 2024).

* Digital models in logistics SMEs can reduce operating costs by up to 15% by optimizing routes and traceability (Cabrera-Gala et al., 2021).

## 1.2.2 Lean UX Process
### 1.2.2.1. Lean UX Problem Statements

Liquor transportation and distribution in Peru seeks to ensure safe and timely deliveries, but today this goal is not met. Operations depend on aging fleets and low digitalization, leading to bottle breakage, partial cargo and fuel theft, and delays. The market demands greater traceability and efficiency, highlighting the limitations of the current system.

Available solutions do not respond to this reality: they are costly, designed for large companies, and poorly adapted to logistics SMEs. They do not directly address the reduction of losses due to breakage nor facilitate coordination between carriers, distributors, and clients, who continue to face high costs and reduced service confidence.

The challenge, therefore, is not to create a predefined tool, but to propose ways to improve the safety and efficiency of distribution. We will know we are on the right track when we observe fewer losses, lower operating costs, and higher customer satisfaction thanks to complete and timely deliveries.

        10:51 - 40:18  
    - **Descriptive Summary:**

        Jordan Paolo Palacín Raraz, 31, works as a primary distribution analyst at Arca Continental Logística, where he has worked for more than two years and has five and a half years of experience in distribution. His profile reflects an analytical, responsible, and methodical personality, with a strong focus on operational efficiency and logistics planning. He demonstrates clear, technical communication centered on problem-solving, evidencing his deep knowledge of national transport and supply processes. In his role, he coordinates product distribution nationwide, ensuring deliveries arrive on time and in the requested quantities. The main clients he serves are the company's own warehouses and wholesalers, with peak periods in summer and year-end months.

His business is characterized by a consolidated trajectory based on trust relationships, mainly with bars, restaurants, and liquor stores, avoiding supermarkets due to high volumes and bonus requirements. Regarding market seasonality, Javier explains that the most demanded products vary by season: spirits (whisky, vodka, 40° rum) sell best in autumn and winter, while beers and ready-to-drink beverages (RTD) dominate spring and summer. Distribution volume fluctuates between 500 and 1000 boxes monthly, depending on seasonality. 

        His main communication channel with clients is WhatsApp, discarding email as slower. He states that his client network has formed through word of mouth and personal recommendations, though he recognizes the need to adapt to the current digital environment, planning to implement social networks as a sales channel soon. Javier shows a receptive attitude towards digitalization, expressing interest in a mobile app to streamline orders, filter clients, and ensure transaction security. He highlights the importance of the system implementing validation filters such as identity verification or RUC registration to prevent fraud, comparing it to classification systems used in services like eDriver or phone apps that identify suspicious calls.

        Regarding operational management, he identifies as a fundamental need knowing the status of his orders in real time, due to frequent delivery delays, especially in Lima, where traffic complicates punctuality. He notes that delays cause time losses and possible cancellations from clients who turn to other distributors, affecting reputation and profitability.

## 2. Impact Mapping

*Impact Mapping* was used as a strategic tool to connect business objectives with the expected actions and behaviors of users. This method allowed us to identify the main actors, their impact on achieving goals, and the deliverables necessary to drive those changes. In the context of **GlassGo**, the impact map facilitated alignment between *Business Goals* and the requirements of the digital product, ensuring that each development directly contributes to fulfilling the project’s objectives.

## 3. Product Backlog

The *Product Backlog* is the prioritized list of features, improvements, and technical requirements that will guide the incremental development of the GlassGo system. It was created based on the *User Stories* and the results of the *Impact Mapping*, with the purpose of structuring the development team’s work in an organized manner, aligned with user needs and business goals. Each backlog item represents a concrete feature, evaluated according to its priority and complexity, allowing for effective planning of future project iterations.

# **Chapter IV: Product Design**
## **4.1. Style Guidelines**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A style guidelines is a set of rules and standards that define how documents, web content, and software should be written, designed, and presented. Below are the specifications of the parameters implemented in the project structure.
</p>

### **4.1.1. General Style Guidelines**

- **Branding History**
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    For the creation of our GlassGo product logo, we opted for a modern and minimalist design that reflects the application's intentions. The logo consists of elegant and simple typography, accompanied by an icon that symbolizes rapid efficiency and product durability during shipping, along with an honest and encouraging phrase. Displaying colors that demonstrate security, speed, and balance such as white, gray, green, orange, and blue.
  </p>

- **Typography**
  <p style="text-align: justify;">

The typography consists of elegant and simple fonts, complementing the icon that symbolizes rapid efficiency and product durability during shipping, along with an honest and encouraging message. The typography uses colors that demonstrate security, speed, and balance including white, gray, green, orange, and blue.

  </p>


- **Colors**
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    GlassGo's color palette consists of tones that convey trust, speed, and professionalism - essential values for a brand focused on secure product delivery. The primary blue reflects stability and security, while orange adds dynamism and movement, reinforcing the idea of immediacy. The neutral gray balances and adds sobriety, ensuring clear and professional communication.
  </p>

  </p>

### **4.1.2. Web Style Guidelines**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For GlassGo, we are planning to develop a web platform. Therefore, we will implement a responsive design (known as Web Responsive Design) with the goal of optimizing information presentation on any device. This will ensure that the content remains intact and ultimately enhance the user experience.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As a team, we have chosen to incorporate the F-pattern design in our website. This pattern is especially suitable for GlassGo, as users tend to explore content quickly and prioritize information at the top and left of the screen. This helps highlight relevant data from the start and facilitates reading of key sections.
</p>

## **4.4. Web Applications UX/UI Design**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design of our landing page aims to offer clear, attractive, and simple digital interaction for visitors. UX focuses on understanding what users seek and expect, organizing information and navigation flows to make the journey comfortable and efficient. UI, on the other hand, deals with the visual aspect, such as the layout of elements, buttons, menus, and content presentation. By combining both approaches, we will achieve a design that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and easy to use, generating a positive experience that motivates users to become interested in our product.

### 5.1.2. Source Code Management

* **GitFlow Workflow**

  The branching model proposed by Vincent Driessen in his article “A successful Git branching model,” known as GitFlow, will be implemented. This model organizes work into the following branches:

  * **main:** Main branch, always contains production code.  
  * **develop:** Main development branch, where features are integrated before going to production.  
  * **feature/\*:** Branches created from develop to develop new features.  
    * Naming convention: feature/<short-descriptive-name>  
      * **Example:** feature/login-auth  
  * **release/\*:** Branches created from develop when preparing a new version for production.  
    * Naming convention: release/<version>  
      * **Example:** release/1.2.0  

* **Commit Conventions**  
  The Conventional Commits standard will be used for commit messages. This will facilitate automation in continuous integration processes and changelog generation.  
  * **feat:** add login functionality  
  * **fix:** correct null pointer exception on user service  
  * **chore:** update dependencies

### 5.1.3. Source Code Style & Conventions

* **Frontend (Landing Page - HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**  
  * **General Conventions:**  
    * **Language:** All code, including variable names, functions, and classes, is written in English.  
    * **Indentation:** 2 spaces.  
    * **File Format:** .html, .css, .js  
    * **Adopted Code Style:**  
      * [W3Schools HTML Style Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp)  
      * [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html)

  * **Naming Conventions:**  
    * **CSS Classes:** kebab-case (e.g., main-container)  
    * **HTML IDs:** camelCase (e.g., mainContent)  
    * **JS Variables:** camelCase (e.g., userName)  
    * **JS Functions:** camelCase (e.g., handleClick())

* **Frontend Web App (Vue.js + JavaScript)**  
  * **General Conventions:**  
    * **Language:** Code is entirely in English.  
    * **Folder Structure:** Segregation by modules and components.  
    * **Indentation:** 2 spaces.  
    * **File Format:** .vue, .js, .css  
    * **Adopted Code Style:**  
      * [Vue.js Style Guide (Official):](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/style-guide.html)  
      * [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

  * **Naming Conventions:**  
    * **Vue Components:** PascalCase (e.g., UserProfile.vue)  
    * **JS Variables and Functions:** camelCase (e.g., userName, handleSubmit())  
    * **Files:** kebab-case (e.g., user-profile.vue)  
    * **Props:** camelCase in JavaScript, kebab-case in HTML templates (e.g., prop: userProfile, usage: user-profile)  
    * **Custom Events:** kebab-case (e.g., user-logged-in)  
    * **CSS Classes:** kebab-case

### 5.1.4. Software Deployment Configuration

This section details the necessary steps to successfully deploy the digital products that make up the solution: the landing page, the web application (frontend), and the Web Services (backend), starting from their respective source code repositories.  
* **Frontend (Landing Page - HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**  
  * **Base Technology:**  
    * **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
    * **Hosting:** GitHub Pages

  * **Configuration and Deployment:**

    *Source Code Repository:* The Landing Page is developed using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All project files must be uploaded to a public repository on GitHub. It is mandatory for the index.html file to be located at the root of the repository (/) for GitHub Pages to correctly detect it as the entry point of the site. Deployment steps on GitHub Pages:

    * Access the repository on GitHub.  
    * Go to the repository's Settings section.  
    * In the sidebar menu, select Pages.  
    * In the Source field, choose:  
      * **Branch:** main  
      * **Folder:** / (root)  
    * Save the changes.

      *Publication:* GitHub will automatically generate a public URL where the Landing Page will be available, in the format: https://\<username\>.github.io/\<repository\>/

      Updates: Any new commit to the main branch will be automatically deployed by GitHub Pages, without the need for additional actions.

* **Frontend Web App (Vue.js + JavaScript)**  
  * **Base Technology:**  
    * **Framework:** Vue 3  
    * **Build Tool:** Vite / Vue CLI (npm run build)  
    * **Hosting:** GitHub Pages

  * **Configuration and Deployment:**

    *Source Code Repository:* The frontend project is hosted on GitHub. The output directory of the build (/dist) contains the files that need to be published.

    *Build:* The command is executed; npm run build. This generates the static files ready for production.

    *Deployment on GitHub Pages:* To publish the content of the /dist directory on GitHub Pages, you can use the gh-pages tool (npm) or perform a manual deployment via a gh-pages branch. A GitHub Actions workflow can also be set up to automate the process. Environment Variables: The URLs of the backend REST services are configured as environment variables (e.g., VITE_API_URL) and are not hardcoded. Differentiated environments:

    * Access the repository on GitHub.  
    * Go to the repository's Settings section.  
    * In the sidebar menu, select Pages.  
    * In the Source field, choose:  
      * **Branch:** main  
      * **Folder:** / (root)  
    * Save the changes.

      *Publication:* GitHub will automatically generate a public URL where the Landing Page will be available, in the format: *https://\<username\>.[github.io/](http://github.io/)\<repository\>/*

      *Updates:* Any new commit to the main branch will be automatically deployed by GitHub Pages, without the need for additional actions.
