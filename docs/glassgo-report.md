## **1.2. Solution Profile**
### **1.2.1 Background and problems**

- **Who *(Who is affected?)***

  - Heavy cargo transport companies in Peru, facing high operating costs due to inefficient routes, vehicle wear, and accidents.
  - Liquor distributors, who must cover economic losses due to glass bottle breakage and partial theft of merchandise during transport.
  - Bar, liquor store, and restaurant owners, who receive incomplete or late orders, affecting inventory planning, promotions, and sales.

- **What *(What happens?)***
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    The logistics chain for liquor transportation in Peru presents structural problems:
  </p>

  - Truck fleets with an average age of 17 years *(MTC, 2023)*, increasing the risk of failures and merchandise damage.
  - **Limited real-time cargo traceability:** only 50% of logistics companies use digital tracking systems *(Andina, 2023)*.
  - Losses due to bottle breakage reach up to 3% of transported cargo in the beverage sector *(Durán, UNI, 2020)*.

- **Where *(Where does it happen?)***

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    The problem occurs in the Peruvian market for alcoholic beverage transportation and distribution, especially on high-consumption interprovincial and urban routes <em>(Lima, Arequipa, Trujillo, Cusco)</em>. The impact is greater on small and medium-sized transport and distribution companies, which lack resources to implement advanced technological solutions.
  </p>

- **When *(Since when and how often?)***

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    This problem is persistent and structural. Although technological advances have improved efficiency in other sectors, digitalization in beverage logistics in Peru is slow. The problem occurs daily with each product delivery and intensifies during high-demand seasons <em>(national holidays, year-end, regional campaigns)</em>.
  </p

- **Why *(Why is it a problem?)***
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    The lack of digitalization and logistical control generates serious consequences:
  </p>

  - **Economic:** losses due to breakage, replacements, theft, and delays losses due to breakage, replacements, theft, and delay.
  - **Operational:** inefficient routes, fleet wear, and lack of traceability.
  - **Commercial:** delivery failures affect trust between distributors and clients.
  - **Strategic:** without consolidated data, it is impossible to plan inventories and optimize costs.

- **How *(How does it manifest?)***

  - Orders arrive incomplete or late.
  - Merchandise damaged during transport *(broken bottles due to vibrations and poor stacking)*.
  - Difficulty monitoring cargo location and status in real time.
  - Informal coordination processes between carriers, distributors, and clients.
  - Limited ability to react to unforeseen events on the road.

- **How Much *(What is the quantitative impact?)***

  - Land transport in Peru moves more than 80% of national cargo *(MTC, 2024)*.
  - Fleet age averages over 17 years, increasing risk of failures *(MTC, 2023)*.
  - Glass container breakage represents up to 3% losses in beverage transport *(Durán, UNI, 2020)*.
  - Road interruptions cause losses of up to S/ 280 million daily in the transport sector *(RPP, 2024)*.
  - Digital models in logistics SMEs can reduce operating costs by up to 15% by optimizing routes and traceability *(Cabrera-Gala et al., 2021)*.

### **1.2.2 Lean UX Process**
#### **1.2.2.1. Lean UX Problem Statements**

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Liquor transportation and distribution in Peru seeks to ensure safe and timely deliveries, but today this goal is not met. Operations depend on aging fleets and low digitalization, leading to bottle breakage, partial cargo and fuel theft, and delays. The market demands greater traceability and efficiency, highlighting the limitations of the current system.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Available solutions do not respond to this reality: they are costly, designed for large companies, and poorly adapted to logistics SMEs. They do not directly address the reduction of losses due to breakage nor facilitate coordination between carriers, distributors, and clients, who continue to face high costs and reduced service confidence.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    The challenge, therefore, is not to create a predefined tool, but to propose ways to improve the safety and efficiency of distribution. We will know we are on the right track when we observe fewer losses, lower operating costs, and higher customer satisfaction thanks to complete and timely deliveries.
  </p>

    - **Timing *(Start - End)*:** 10:51 - 40:18  
    - **Descriptive Summary:**

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Jordan Paolo Palacín Raraz, 31, works as a primary distribution analyst at Arca Continental Logística, where he has worked for more than two years and has five and a half years of experience in distribution. His profile reflects an analytical, responsible, and methodical personality, with a strong focus on operational efficiency and logistics planning. He demonstrates clear, technical communication centered on problem-solving, evidencing his deep knowledge of national transport and supply processes. In his role, he coordinates product distribution nationwide, ensuring deliveries arrive on time and in the requested quantities. The main clients he serves are the company's own warehouses and wholesalers, with peak periods in summer and year-end months.  
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Regarding his technological environment, he uses an Android mobile phone <em>(Samsung)</em> and a Toshiba T40 laptop, tools that allow him to maintain continuous connection with carriers and suppliers. Within the company, they use the Geotab platform, a GPS system that centralizes fleet monitoring nationwide, allowing visualization of unit transit, report generation, and tracking of critical products. However, he recognizes that the system has limitations in rugged areas of the country, where the signal is interrupted.  
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The company works with contracted carriers and third parties, who manage their own maintenance and wear costs. His role involves ensuring efficient route planning, prioritizing critical products, and always seeking to balance transport costs with maximum load capacity utilization <em>(filling as many pallets as possible per unit)</em>. He explains that the freight agreed with contracted carriers is more competitive, while third-party freight is usually higher, so they must optimize route assignment according to convenience and efficiency.  
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Regarding operational problems, he mentions that product losses and shrinkage are frequent, mainly due to stacking type and poor road conditions. These failures impact unit returnability and therefore require routine weekly reports. The user values emerging technologies such as onboard cameras to detect driver fatigue and monitor incidents, as well as fuel sensors to identify theft by analyzing real-time consumption. He considers these tools a necessary evolution, although he recognizes that their high cost limits adoption by third-party carriers.  
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Finally, he mentions that the company is in the process of migrating to the SAP S/4HANA system and soon to TMS <em>(Transport Management System)</em>, aiming to automate route planning, cubing, and costs, reducing the time of analytical processes.

      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        His team is small but efficient, focused on logistics coordination and delivery integrity. Regarding technology use, the main tool is the smartphone, used by both drivers and logistics staff for daily communication and coordination. They also use computers for general management and spreadsheets for semi-manual route planning, combining traditional procedures with basic digital resources.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The user employs standard GPS systems for location tracking and delivery progress monitoring. However, he recognizes limitations in automation and data accuracy.

These shortcomings can represent additional costs.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Finally, the user expresses that an ideal solution for his company should be characterized by ease of use, especially from mobile applications, so that both he and his team can integrate it without needing complex technical knowledge.

At 48, he presents himself as an organized, strategic professional with strong negotiation skills, allowing him to effectively lead his team and truck fleet. His role combines executive management with direct involvement in commercial agreements, investment decisions, and supplier management, while delegating daily logistics coordination to a specialized supervisor.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The company's operations focus mainly on serving hotels, restaurant chains, medium and large liquor stores, and supermarkets. Peak demand periods occur during July campaigns <em>(National Holidays)</em> and December <em>(Christmas and New Year)</em>, as well as gastronomic fairs and corporate events, reaching up to 600 monthly deliveries, representing about 40% of total operations.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Regarding technology use, the organization uses computers and laptops for administrative and accounting tasks, while drivers use Android phones with GPS for route coordination and report sending. Additionally, tools like WhatsApp and spreadsheets are used for inventory control, invoicing, and operational communication, evidencing a partially functional but not highly developed digital environment.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        However, Omar recognizes significant limitations in current management, particularly in timely identification of incidents, which depends on late reports from drivers or customer complaints. This affects satisfaction and trust of key clients, generating additional costs associated with product replacement, overtime, penalties, and urgent shipments.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Therefore, the interviewee considers implementing advanced technological solutions that allow real-time tracking, automatic report generation, and early alerts for possible delays or incidents a priority. He emphasizes that any innovation must guarantee a clear and measurable return on investment, demonstrating a pragmatic and results-oriented view regarding the adoption of new digital platforms.

    - **Timing *(Start - End)*:** 01:04:36 - 01:14:50
    - **Descriptive Summary:**

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Luis Javier Jiménez Sandoval, a 52-year-old businessman from Lima, has 28 years of experience in liquor sales and distribution, both wholesale and retail, within Lima Metropolitan sector. His business is characterized by a consolidated trajectory based on trust relationships, mainly with bars, restaurants, and liquor stores, avoiding supermarkets due to high volumes and bonus requirements. Regarding market seasonality, Javier explains that the most demanded products vary by season: spirits <em>(whisky, vodka, 40° rum)</em> sell best in autumn and winter, while beers and ready-to-drink beverages <em>(RTD)</em> dominate spring and summer. Distribution volume fluctuates between 500 and 1000 boxes monthly, depending on seasonality.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        His main communication channel with clients is WhatsApp, discarding email as slower. He states that his client network has formed through word of mouth and personal recommendations, though he recognizes the need to adapt to the current digital environment, planning to implement social networks as a sales channel soon. Javier shows a receptive attitude towards digitalization, expressing interest in a mobile app to streamline orders, filter clients, and ensure transaction security. He highlights the importance of the system implementing validation filters such as identity verification or RUC registration to prevent fraud, comparing it to classification systems used in services like eDriver or phone apps that identify suspicious calls.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Regarding operational management, he identifies as a fundamental need knowing the status of his orders in real time, due to frequent delivery delays, especially in Lima, where traffic complicates punctuality. He notes that delays cause time losses and possible cancellations from clients who turn to other distributors, affecting reputation and profitability. He considers that logistics indicators within an app should allow inventory management, product rotation control, and display of the available sales catalog, all within a secure and accessible environment for verified clients.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The user also commented on negative experiences in the field, such as client scams and fake payments. Therefore, he insists that any digital system must include security and buyer validation mechanisms, as well as georeferenced tracking of delivery units to visualize routes and delivery status in real time. Finally, he recommends that developers of such platforms consider the “hidden variables” of the liquor market, such as volume bonuses, loyalty rewards <em>(trips, appliances, cars)</em>, and logistics costs from traffic and urban delays, to offer a comprehensive system reflecting the real value of the operation.

  - **Insights**

    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
      <li>
        Although companies use GPS or digital platforms, the Android smartphone remains the central tool for daily coordination. This shows practical but still limited digitalization, focused more on communication than automation.
      </li>
      <li>
        All three managers value technological solutions that provide tangible efficiency without requiring complex processes. This suggests the market is ready for intuitive, modular tools rather than large-scale systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Recurring losses due to poor stacking or bad roads reflect the lack of integration between digital monitoring and physical management of operations, opening space for predictive or early alert systems.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
      <li>
        Technology is used more for communication and basic management than for comprehensive logistics control; there is still dependence on spreadsheets and manual reports.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some actors, especially the more digitalized, demand systems with anti-fraud validation and order monitoring to prevent scams or failed deliveries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Despite decades of experience, segment leaders still lack automated management tools integrating logistics and commercial information.

        Business owners want to visualize the status of their orders, deliveries, and confirmations in real time.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is strong dependence on WhatsApp as a management channel with suppliers, which could be integrated into the GlassGo proposal.
      </li>
      <li>

- **Segment 1: Truck Transport Companies**

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    The User Persona Jorge Mendoza represents independent heavy cargo carriers, responsible for transporting beverages between different cities in the country. Jorge has more than twenty years of experience in the field and works with an aging fleet that causes operational difficulties and losses due to bottle breakage. He has tried some geolocation tools, but none really adapt to local route conditions or his level of digital familiarity. His main motivation is to optimize routes and reduce fuel and maintenance costs, achieving timely deliveries to maintain his reputation and contracts. He seeks a simple, accessible, and reliable solution to monitor his cargo without relying on manual processes or phone calls.

    The User Persona Andrea Flores represents liquor distributors, responsible for ensuring orders arrive complete and in good condition. Andrea manages distribution logistics for bars and restaurants in Lima, frequently facing losses due to partial thefts or damaged bottles during transport. Although she has implemented some control systems, these are often expensive or not adaptable to her company's needs.

    The User Persona José Álvarez represents bar and liquor store owners, who depend on supplier punctuality to maintain sales flow. José manages a bar in Miraflores and has had to deal with late or incomplete deliveries that directly affect his inventory and promotions.

His main motivation is to have a system providing transparency and punctuality in orders, allowing better purchase planning and avoiding losses due to lack of stock. He seeks an intuitive, visual, and easily accessible tool to receive real-time delivery notifications and maintain direct communication with suppliers.

# **Chapter III: Requirements Specification**
## **3.1. User Stories**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  User Stories describe system requirements from the end-user perspective, prioritizing the functionality and value that each action provides. In the GlassGo project, stories were formulated based on the needs identified during the user analysis and empathy stages, with the goal of ensuring a consistent, efficient, and human-centered experience for the people interacting with the platform.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Each story clearly defines who the user is, what they want to achieve, and their goal. It also includes verifiable acceptance criteria that ensure compliance with the expected behavior.

## **3.2. Impact Mapping**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Impact Mapping was used as a strategic tool to connect business objectives with the expected actions and behaviors of users. This method allowed us to identify the main actors, their impact on achieving goals, and the deliverables necessary to drive those changes. In the context GlassGo, the impact map facilitated alignment between Business Goals and the requirements of the digital product, ensuring that each development directly contributes to fulfilling the project’s objectives.

## **3.3 Product Backlog**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The Product Backlog is the prioritized list of features, improvements, and technical requirements that will guide the incremental development of the GlassGo system. It was created based on the User Stories and the results of the Impact Mapping, with the purpose of structuring the development team’s work in an organized manner, aligned with user needs and business goals. Each backlog item represents a concrete feature, evaluated according to its priority and complexity, allowing for effective planning of future project iterations.

## **4.1. Style Guidelines**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A style guidelines is a set of rules and standards that define how documents, web content, and software should be written, designed, and presented. Below are the specifications of the parameters implemented in the project structure.
</p>

### **4.1.1. General Style Guidelines**

- **Branding History**
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    For the creation of our GlassGo product logo, we opted for a modern and minimalist design that reflects the application's intentions. The logo consists of elegant and simple typography, accompanied by an icon that symbolizes rapid efficiency and product durability during shipping, along with an honest and encouraging phrase. Displaying colors that demonstrate security, speed, and balance such as white, gray, green, orange, and blue.
  </p>

      <img src="../src/images/chapter4/style-guidelines/general/typography-2.png" width="25%">
  </p>


- **Colors**
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    GlassGo's color palette consists of tones that convey trust, speed, and professionalism - essential values for a brand focused on secure product delivery. The primary blue reflects stability and security, while orange adds dynamism and movement, reinforcing the idea of immediacy. The neutral gray balances and adds sobriety, ensuring clear and professional communication.
  </p>
  
  - Blue → *#002140*
  - Medium Gray → *#6B6B6B*
  - White → *#FFFFFF*
  - Black → *#000000*

  </p>

### **4.1.2. Web Style Guidelines**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For GlassGo, we are planning to develop a web platform. Therefore, we will implement a responsive design (known as Web Responsive Design) with the goal of optimizing information presentation on any device. This will ensure that the content remains intact and ultimately enhance the user experience.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As a team, we have chosen to incorporate the F-pattern design in our website. This pattern is especially suitable for GlassGo, as users tend to explore content quickly and prioritize information at the top and left of the screen. This helps highlight relevant data from the start and facilitates reading of key sections.
</p>

## **4.4. Web Applications UX/UI Design**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design of our landing page aims to offer clear, attractive, and simple digital interaction for visitors. UX focuses on understanding what users seek and expect, organizing information and navigation flows to make the journey comfortable and efficient. UI, on the other hand, deals with the visual aspect, such as the layout of elements, buttons, menus, and content presentation. By combining both approaches, we will achieve a design that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and easy to use, generating a positive experience that motivates users to become interested in our product.

### 5.1.2. Source Code Management

* **GitFlow Workflow**

  The branching model proposed by Vincent Driessen in his article “A successful Git branching model,” known as GitFlow, will be implemented. This model organizes work into the following branches:

  * **main:** Main branch, always contains production code.  
  * **develop:** Main development branch, where features are integrated before going to production.  
  * **feature/\*:** Branches created from develop to develop new features.  
    * Naming convention: feature/<short-descriptive-name>  
      * **Example:** feature/login-auth  
  * **release/\*:** Branches created from develop when preparing a new version for production.  
    * Naming convention: release/<version>  
      * **Example:** release/1.2.0  

* **Commit Conventions**  
  The Conventional Commits standard will be used for commit messages. This will facilitate automation in continuous integration processes and changelog generation.  
  * **feat:** add login functionality  
  * **fix:** correct null pointer exception on user service  
  * **chore:** update dependencies

### 5.1.3. Source Code Style & Conventions

* **Frontend (Landing Page - HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**  
  * **General Conventions:**  
    * **Language:** All code, including variable names, functions, and classes, is written in English.  
    * **Indentation:** 2 spaces.  
    * **File Format:** .html, .css, .js  
    * **Adopted Code Style:**  
      * [W3Schools HTML Style Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp)  
      * [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html)

  * **Naming Conventions:**  
    * **CSS Classes:** kebab-case (e.g., main-container)  
    * **HTML IDs:** camelCase (e.g., mainContent)  
    * **JS Variables:** camelCase (e.g., userName)  
    * **JS Functions:** camelCase (e.g., handleClick())

* **Frontend Web App (Vue.js + JavaScript)**  
  * **General Conventions:**

  * **Naming Conventions:**  
    * **Vue Components:** PascalCase (e.g., UserProfile.vue)  
    * **JS Variables and Functions:** camelCase (e.g., userName, handleSubmit())  
    * **Files:** kebab-case (e.g., user-profile.vue)  
    * **Props:** camelCase in JavaScript, kebab-case in HTML templates (e.g., prop: userProfile, usage: user-profile)  
    * **Custom Events:** kebab-case (e.g., user-logged-in)  
    * **CSS Classes:** kebab-case

### 5.1.4. Software Deployment Configuration

This section details the necessary steps to successfully deploy the digital products that make up the solution: the landing page, the web application (frontend), and the Web Services (backend), starting from their respective source code repositories.  
* **Frontend (Landing Page - HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**  
  * **Base Technology:**  
    * **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
    * **Hosting:** GitHub Pages

  * **Configuration and Deployment:**

    *Source Code Repository:* The Landing Page is developed using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All project files must be uploaded to a public repository on GitHub. It is mandatory for the index.html file to be located at the root of the repository (/) for GitHub Pages to correctly detect it as the entry point of the site. Deployment steps on GitHub Pages:

    * Access the repository on GitHub.  
    * Go to the repository's Settings section.  
    * In the sidebar menu, select Pages.  
    * In the Source field, choose:  
      * **Branch:** main  
      * **Folder:** / (root)  
    * Save the changes.

      *Publication:* GitHub will automatically generate a public URL where the Landing Page will be available, in the format: https://\<username\>.github.io/\<repository\>/

      Updates: Any new commit to the main branch will be automatically deployed by GitHub Pages, without the need for additional actions.

* **Frontend Web App (Vue.js + JavaScript)**  
  * **Base Technology:**  
    * **Framework:** Vue 3  
    * **Build Tool:** Vite / Vue CLI (npm run build)  
    * **Hosting:** GitHub Pages

  * **Configuration and Deployment:**

    *Source Code Repository:* The frontend project is hosted on GitHub. The output directory of the build (/dist) contains the files that need to be published.

    *Build:* The command is executed; npm run build. This generates the static files ready for production.

    *Deployment on GitHub Pages:* To publish the content of the /dist directory on GitHub Pages, you can use the gh-pages tool (npm) or perform a manual deployment via a gh-pages branch. A GitHub Actions workflow can also be set up to automate the process. Environment Variables: The URLs of the backend REST services are configured as environment variables (e.g., VITE_API_URL) and are not hardcoded. Differentiated environments:

    * Access the repository on GitHub.  
    * Go to the repository's Settings section.  
    * In the sidebar menu, select Pages.  
    * In the Source field, choose:  
      * **Branch:** main  
      * **Folder:** / (root)  
    * Save the changes.

      *Publication:* GitHub will automatically generate a public URL where the Landing Page will be available, in the format: *https://\<username\>.[github.io/](http://github.io/)\<repository\>/*

      *Updates:* Any new commit to the main branch will be automatically deployed by GitHub Pages, without the need for additional actions.

| Sprint Goal & User Stories |  |
| Sprint 3 Goal | Nuestro enfoque está en presentar de forma efectiva nuestra propuesta de valor a los nuevos visitantes. También, habilitar la gestión de recetas y pedidos, así como mejorar la sección de ventas, para los administradores de restaurantes; incorporar la gestión de órdenes para los proveedores; y, en general, permitir a ambos segmentos realizar el pago de su suscripción. Asimismo, proporcionar, mediante el API de la plataforma, puntos de accesos a los desarrolladores frontend para que implementen funcionalidades relacionadas con gestión de pedidos, ventas, recetas, inventario, perfil y comentarios. Creemos que esto ofrece a los visitantes mayor confianza hacia el equipo de trabajo y les permite conocer mejor la propuesta de valor. Del mismo modo, mejora los flujos de usuario, al permitir la realización de pagos de suscripción; agiliza las operaciones para los administradores de restaurantes, al facilitar la creación y gestión de ventas, la configuración de recetas y la gestión de pedidos; optimiza el tiempo operativo para los proveedores, al permitir el seguimiento de pedidos. Además, permite a los desarrolladores frontend implementar funcionalidades esenciales de forma más eficiente, incluyendo pedidos, ventas, recetas, inventario, perfil y comentarios. |
