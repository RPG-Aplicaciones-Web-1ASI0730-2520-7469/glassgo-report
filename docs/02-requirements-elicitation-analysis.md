         01:04:36 - 01:14:50 
    - **Descriptive Summary:**

        Luis Javier Jiménez Sandoval, a 52-year-old businessman from Lima, has 28 years of experience in liquor sales and distribution, both wholesale and retail, within Lima Metropolitan sector. His business is characterized by a consolidated trajectory based on trust relationships, mainly with bars, restaurants, and liquor stores, avoiding supermarkets due to high volumes and bonus requirements. Regarding market seasonality, Javier explains that the most demanded products vary by season: spirits (whisky, vodka, 40° rum) sell best in autumn and winter, while beers and ready-to-drink beverages (RTD) dominate spring and summer. Distribution volume fluctuates between 500 and 1000 boxes monthly, depending on seasonality. 

        His main communication channel with clients is WhatsApp, discarding email as slower. He states that his client network has formed through word of mouth and personal recommendations, though he recognizes the need to adapt to the current digital environment, planning to implement social networks as a sales channel soon. Javier shows a receptive attitude towards digitalization, expressing interest in a mobile app to streamline orders, filter clients, and ensure transaction security. He highlights the importance of the system implementing validation filters such as identity verification or RUC registration to prevent fraud, comparing it to classification systems used in services like eDriver or phone apps that identify suspicious calls.

        Regarding operational management, he identifies as a fundamental need knowing the status of his orders in real time, due to frequent delivery delays, especially in Lima, where traffic complicates punctuality. He notes that delays cause time losses and possible cancellations from clients who turn to other distributors, affecting reputation and profitability. He considers that logistics indicators within an app should allow inventory management, product rotation control, and display of the available sales catalog, all within a secure and accessible environment for verified clients.

        The user also commented on negative experiences in the field, such as client scams and fake payments. Therefore, he insists that any digital system must include security and buyer validation mechanisms, as well as georeferenced tracking of delivery units to visualize routes and delivery status in real time. Finally, he recommends that developers of such platforms consider the “hidden variables” of the liquor market, such as volume bonuses, loyalty rewards (trips, appliances, cars), and logistics costs from traffic and urban delays, to offer a comprehensive system reflecting the real value of the operation.

This approach reflects a simple but functional digital management environment, based on trust and continuous communication.

        Regarding supplier selection criteria, Carla prioritizes trust, product quality, and brand reputation in the market.

He does not mention using specialized software, but rather common and accessible tools, indicating a medium level of digitalization.

        Alejandro uses WhatsApp as the main means to interact with suppliers, highlighting its speed and practicality. For larger or more formal suppliers, he resorts to email or corporate profiles, reflecting adaptability depending on the interlocutor.
