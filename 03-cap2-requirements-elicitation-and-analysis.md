    - **Timing *(Start - End)*:** 00:00 - 10:48
    - **Descriptive Summary:**

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Luis Abad Palacin López, operations manager at HPL Transport SAC, is a professional with more than 20 years of experience in road freight transport. At 50 years old, he is characterized by a meticulous, analytical personality oriented towards operational efficiency, reflected in his process management and fleet supervision. His leadership combines discipline and logistical control with a preventive approach to road safety and technical maintenance. The company has a fleet of trucks mainly transporting containers and finished products from Cervecería Backus, operating in Lima, provinces, and the Peruvian jungle. The help of logistics partners is crucial to continue expanding their national reach, making communication and planning between the logistics center and transport drivers highly important, especially during peak demand seasons such as national holidays, Christmas, and New Year.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The technologies used by Luis include the Frotcom platform for fleet tracking and control, smartphones, and personal computers with the popular Windows operating system. Essential tools for real-time visualization of units, establishing geofences, defining authorized stops, and notifying about unauthorized deviations.  
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Additionally, the mentioned system can obtain metrics such as fuel consumption and tire wear. An attractive feature for the user to consider the complete context of each unit.

    - **Timing *(Start - End)*:** 10:51 - 40:18  
    - **Descriptive Summary:**

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Jordan Paolo Palacín Raraz, 31, works as a primary distribution analyst at Arca Continental Logística, where he has worked for more than two years and has five and a half years of experience in distribution. His profile reflects an analytical, responsible, and methodical personality, with a strong focus on operational efficiency and logistics planning. He demonstrates clear, technical communication centered on problem-solving, evidencing his deep knowledge of national transport and supply processes. In his role, he coordinates product distribution nationwide, ensuring deliveries arrive on time and in the requested quantities. The main clients he serves are the company's own warehouses and wholesalers, with peak periods in summer and year-end months.  
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Regarding his technological environment, he uses an Android mobile phone <em>(Samsung)</em> and a Toshiba T40 laptop, tools that allow him to maintain continuous connection with carriers and suppliers. Within the company, they use the Geotab platform, a GPS system that centralizes fleet monitoring nationwide, allowing visualization of unit transit, report generation, and tracking of critical products. However, he recognizes that the system has limitations in rugged areas of the country, where the signal is interrupted.  
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The company works with contracted carriers and third parties, who manage their own maintenance and wear costs. His role involves ensuring efficient route planning, prioritizing critical products, and always seeking to balance transport costs with maximum load capacity utilization <em>(filling as many pallets as possible per unit)</em>. He explains that the freight agreed with contracted carriers is more competitive, while third-party freight is usually higher, so they must optimize route assignment according to convenience and efficiency.  
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Regarding operational problems, he mentions that product losses and shrinkage are frequent, mainly due to stacking type and poor road conditions. These failures impact unit returnability and therefore require routine weekly reports. The user values emerging technologies such as onboard cameras to detect driver fatigue and monitor incidents, as well as fuel sensors to identify theft by analyzing real-time consumption. He considers these tools a necessary evolution, although he recognizes that their high cost limits adoption by third-party carriers.  
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Finally, he mentions that the company is in the process of migrating to the SAP S/4HANA system and soon to TMS <em>(Transport Management System)</em>, aiming to automate route planning, cubing, and costs, reducing the time of analytical processes.

    - **Descriptive Summary:**

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Omar is the general manager of a liquor distributor located in Arequipa, with 18 years of experience in the sector. At 48, he presents himself as an organized, strategic professional with strong negotiation skills, allowing him to effectively lead his team and truck fleet.

      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The company's operations focus mainly on serving hotels, restaurant chains, medium and large liquor stores, and supermarkets.

    - **Timing *(Start - End)*:** 01:04:36 - 01:14:50
    - **Descriptive Summary:**

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Luis Javier Jiménez Sandoval, a 52-year-old businessman from Lima, has 28 years of experience in liquor sales and distribution, both wholesale and retail, within Lima Metropolitan sector. His business is characterized by a consolidated trajectory based on trust relationships, mainly with bars, restaurants, and liquor stores, avoiding supermarkets due to high volumes and bonus requirements. Regarding market seasonality, Javier explains that the most demanded products vary by season: spirits <em>(whisky, vodka, 40° rum)</em> sell best in autumn and winter, while beers and ready-to-drink beverages <em>(RTD)</em> dominate spring and summer. Distribution volume fluctuates between 500 and 1000 boxes monthly, depending on seasonality.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        His main communication channel with clients is WhatsApp, discarding email as slower. He states that his client network has formed through word of mouth and personal recommendations, though he recognizes the need to adapt to the current digital environment, planning to implement social networks as a sales channel soon. Javier shows a receptive attitude towards digitalization, expressing interest in a mobile app to streamline orders, filter clients, and ensure transaction security. He highlights the importance of the system implementing validation filters such as identity verification or RUC registration to prevent fraud, comparing it to classification systems used in services like eDriver or phone apps that identify suspicious calls.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Regarding operational management, he identifies as a fundamental need knowing the status of his orders in real time, due to frequent delivery delays, especially in Lima, where traffic complicates punctuality. He notes that delays cause time losses and possible cancellations from clients who turn to other distributors, affecting reputation and profitability. He considers that logistics indicators within an app should allow inventory management, product rotation control, and display of the available sales catalog, all within a secure and accessible environment for verified clients.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The user also commented on negative experiences in the field, such as client scams and fake payments. Therefore, he insists that any digital system must include security and buyer validation mechanisms, as well as georeferenced tracking of delivery units to visualize routes and delivery status in real time. Finally, he recommends that developers of such platforms consider the “hidden variables” of the liquor market, such as volume bonuses, loyalty rewards <em>(trips, appliances, cars)</em>, and logistics costs from traffic and urban delays, to offer a comprehensive system reflecting the real value of the operation.

  - **Insights**

    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
      <li>
        Although companies use GPS or digital platforms, the Android smartphone remains the central tool for daily coordination. This shows practical but still limited digitalization, focused more on communication than automation.
      </li>
      <li>
        All three managers value technological solutions that provide tangible efficiency without requiring complex processes. This suggests the market is ready for intuitive, modular tools rather than large-scale systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Recurring losses due to poor stacking or bad roads reflect the lack of integration between digital monitoring and physical management of operations, opening space for predictive or early alert systems.
      </li>
    </ul>

  - **Insights:**

    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
      <li>
        Technology is used more for communication and basic management than for comprehensive logistics control; there is still dependence on spreadsheets and manual reports.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some actors, especially the more digitalized, demand systems with anti-fraud validation and order monitoring to prevent scams or failed deliveries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Despite decades of experience, segment leaders still lack automated management tools integrating logistics and commercial information.

## **2.3. Needfinding**
### **2.3.1. User Personas**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This section presents three User Personas representing the project's key segments: Freight Carriers, Liquor Distributors, and Bar/Liquor Store Owners. These profiles allow a deep understanding of the needs, motivations, frustrations, and behaviors of potential users of the GlassGo system, a platform seeking to improve traceability, efficiency, and security in the transport of glass-packaged liquors in Peru.
</p>

- **Segment 1: Truck Transport Companies**

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    The User Persona Jorge Mendoza represents independent heavy cargo carriers, responsible for transporting beverages between different cities in the country. Jorge has more than twenty years of experience in the field and works with an aging fleet that causes operational difficulties and losses due to bottle breakage. He has tried some geolocation tools, but none really adapt to local route conditions or his level of digital familiarity. His main motivation is to optimize routes and reduce fuel and maintenance costs, achieving timely deliveries to maintain his reputation and contracts. He seeks a simple, accessible, and reliable solution to monitor his cargo without relying on manual processes or phone calls.

- **Segment 2: Liquor Suppliers**

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    The User Persona Andrea Flores represents liquor distributors, responsible for ensuring orders arrive complete and in good condition. Andrea manages distribution logistics for bars and restaurants in Lima, frequently facing losses due to partial thefts or damaged bottles during transport. Although she has implemented some control systems, these are often expensive or not adaptable to her company's needs. Her main motivation is to have total cargo traceability and minimize risks in each delivery, ensuring client trust. She seeks a platform offering real-time visibility, automatic alerts, and simple reports to make quick decisions without relying on multiple communication channels.

- **Segment 3: Business Owners**

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    The User Persona José Álvarez represents bar and liquor store owners, who depend on supplier punctuality to maintain sales flow. José manages a bar in Miraflores and has had to deal with late or incomplete deliveries that directly affect his inventory and promotions. He has tried to control orders using spreadsheets and messaging, but these methods are inefficient and inaccurate. His main motivation is to have a system providing transparency and punctuality in orders, allowing better purchase planning and avoiding losses due to lack of stock. He seeks an intuitive, visual, and easily accessible tool to receive real-time delivery notifications and maintain direct communication with suppliers.
